>Success is a journey, not a destination. The doing is often more important than the outcome.

What's in a goal? Several years back, Eitam and Higgins [@eitamhiggins2014] posed this question in response to a new paper suggesting that activated goals trigger patterns of cognition and behavior aimed solely at the attainment of desired *end-states* [@huangbargh2014]. Although Huang and Bargh's [-@huangbargh2014] proposal fit with a longstanding hedonic perspective on motivation [e.g., @bentham1823; @hull1950], a range of scholars have pushed back on this limited outcome-oriented conceptualization of goal pursuit, suggesting that people also find the *process* of goal pursuit motivating. As noted by the common adage, it's not only about the destination: How and why people engage in the journey matter.

A number of motivation scientists have theorized about the activities that constitute such journeys [e.g., @carverscheier1998; @kruglanskietal2000; @gollwitzer1990]. Although the details of these proposals differ, each advances the notion that goal pursuit processes necessarily involve the dynamic interplay of thought and action, planning and doing, looking and leaping. As described by Atkinson [-@atkinson1957, p. 359], "The first problem is to account for an individual's selection of one path of action among a set of possible alternatives. The second problem is to account for the amplitude of the action tendency once it is initiated, and for its tendency to persist for a time in a given situation." Higgins' [-@higgins2012c] theory of motivational effectiveness integrates these perspectives, proposing that people ultimately want to feel effective in three domains. The domain of value relates to the attainment of desired and undesired end-states as described by Huang and Bargh [-@huangbargh2014]. However, the two remaining domains—truth and control—relate to feeling effective in the process of goal pursuit. Truth motivation captures the desire to feel effective in establishing what is real and right; control motivation involves the desire to effective manage what happens in one's life [@higgins2012c]. Although there appears to be a fairly broad consensus that the goal pursuit process encompasses both truth- and control-oriented activities, the field's understanding of why people may choose to engage in certain activities but not others remains limited. For instance, with regard to truth, what motivates people to curiously explore novel ideas versus meticulously scrutinize existing ones? With respect to control, why do some people tend to jump quickly into action, whereas others cautiously defend their existing status quo?

We propose that regulatory focus theory [@higgins1997; @higgins1998b] offers unique insight into these questions. Regulatory focus theory proposes that two basic self-regulatory systems motivate much of human behavior. The prevention system is motivated by fundamental needs for safety and security; as a result, people with a prevention focus are strategically concerned with approaching positive end-states involving non-losses and avoiding negative end-states involving losses. In contrast, the promotion system is motivated by fundamental needs for nurturance and growth; as a result, people with a promotion focus are strategically concerned with approaching positive end-states involving gains and avoiding negative end-states involving non-gains. Recently, these different kinds of end-states have also been conceptualized as reference points on a number line [@higgins2018]. The prevention system treats a satisfactory "0" status quo state (or anything above it) as a desirable reference point and "-1" states (or anything below them) as negative reference points. In contrast, the promotion system "+1" states (or anything above them) as desirable reference points, whereas a "0" status quo state (or anything below it) is treated as an undesirable reference point. Although it is well-established that the prevention and promotion systems are motivated by these different kinds of end-states, relatively less is known about how these systems impact goal pursuit processes.

Some of what the field *does* know about prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit processes has been revealed through research related to regulatory fit theory [@higgins2000]. People experience a state of regulatory fit when the strategic means they use in goal pursuit align with and sustain their motivational orientation, and this kind of fit has important consequences for people's choices to engage in certain activities [@higginsetal2010], their enjoyment of such fitting activities [@freitashiggins2002], and even their activity performance [@plessneretal2009]. Although regulatory fit has been studied with respect to different motivational systems, regulatory fit research examining regulatory focus provides useful insight into the kinds of goal pursuit activities that might be motivated the prevention versus promotion systems. Specifically, people with a prevention focus prefer to pursue goals using vigilant, avoidance-related strategies, whereas people with a promotion focus prefer to pursue goals using eager, approach-related strategies [@higginsetal1994]. In addition to research grounded in regulatory fit, the broader regulatory focus literature has grown rapidly since the theory's inception, and a number of these papers offer glimpses into the activities motivated by each system. With this said, it seemed to us that the field could benefit from a more integrated approach to identifying and studying promotion and prevention-specific goal pursuit processes. The present research proposes and tests such a framework.

# Hypothesized Framework of Prevention- and Promotion-Specific Goal Pursuit Activities

We predict that the prevention and promotion systems' general strategic preferences as well as focus-relevant reference points (i.e., "-1", "0", "+1") will be reflected in the specific kinds of goal pursuit activities that are motivated by each system. To this end, we propose a novel, integrative framework of prevention and promotion goal pursuit activities in the domains of truth and control. In the sections that follow, we outline the conceptual and empirical support for this proposal.

## Activities Associated with Prevention

Because the prevention system is motivated to avoid "-1" loss states and maintain a satisfactory "0" status quo, we predict that these preferences will also apply to the domains of truth and control. In the domain of truth, a "-1" reference point would seem to reflect an error, mistake, or misunderstanding. Given the prevention system's predilection for vigilance—that is, avoiding matches to undesired end-states [@crowehiggins1997; @higginsetal1994]—a vigilant truth process would tend to prioritize certainty, rightness, and accuracy. Thus, we propose that truth-oriented goal pursuit activities motivated by prevention would likely involve the careful, thorough review and scrupulous verification of existing information. Although relatively little empirical work has tested this proposal, some research has shown that a prevention focus is associated with: accuracy (*vs.* speed) in decision making [@forsteretal2003]; analytical (*vs.* creative) problem solving [@friedmanforster2005]; a preference for using deliberative reasoning (*vs.* intuitive feelings) when making judgments [@avnethiggins2006; @cornwellhiggins2016]; and increased discounting of negative (*vs.* positive) prospects over uncertainty [@halamishetal2008].

In the domain of control, a "0" satisfactory status quo reference point would seem to involve the active maintenance of an acceptable present situation in one's life, whereas a "-1" reference point would reflect the loss of this satisfactory state. Given the prevention system's preference for vigilance, a prevention-focused control process would tend to prioritize preservation, stewardship, and protection. As a result, we propose that control-oriented goal pursuit activities motivated by prevention would likely involve the cautious defense of the present status quo against potential threats. This proposal is supported by work suggesting that prevention-focused leaders will tend to value conservation values like tradition and conformity [@karkvandijk2007] and preserve interpersonal norms [@zhangetal2011]. Further, a prevention focus is associated with conservative political ideology [@cornwellhiggins2013] and decision making [@bolderohiggins2011], both of which involve the perpetuation of the current status quo. Finally, the prevention system tends to prefer stability over change [@libermanetal1999].

## Activities Associated with Promotion

We took a similar approach when conceptualizing promotion goal pursuit activities. Because the promotion system is motivated to approach "+1" gain states and avoid the "0" status quo, we first considered how these states would apply in the domain of truth. A "+1" truth-oriented reference point would seem to reflect knowledge generation and growth, whereas a "0" reference point might capture a state of mental stagnation. Given the promotion system's preference for eagerness—that is, approaching matches to desired end-states[@crowehiggins1997; @higginsetal1994]—an eager truth process would likely prioritize curiosity, ideation, and discovery. Thus, we propose that truth-oriented goal pursuit process motivated by promotion would tend to involve curious exploration, brainstorming, and openly seeking out new ideas. Some empirical work supports this proposal. For instance, a promotion focus is associated with greater experiences of curiosity [@wytykowskagabinska2015]; divergent thinking [@beukbasadur2016; @memmertetal2013]; abstract, high-level construals [@leeetal2010]; openness to experience [@higginsetal2008a]; creative (*vs.* analytical) problem solving [@friedmanforster2005]; and innovation [@wallaceetal2016].

Turning to the domain of control, a "+1" reference point would seem to involve managing what happens in one's life by efficiently and smoothly effecting change, whereas a "0" reference point would reflect the feeling of being stuck in one's undesirable status quo. Given the promotion system's preference for eagerness, a promotion-focused control process would tend to prioritize the speed and acceleration of goal-directed action. As a result, we propose that control-oriented goal pursuit activities motivated by prevention would likely involve advancing forward quickly in one's goal pursuits and implementing change processes. This proposal is supported by work suggesting that the promotion system is associated with the regulatory mode of locomotion, a motivational orientation concerned with movement and change [@higginsetal2008a; @kruglanskietal2000]. Further, a promotion focus is known to be associated with speed (*vs.* accuracy) in decision making [@forsteretal2003]; openness to change [@karkvandijk2007]; transformational, change-oriented leadership [@karkvandijk2007]; and a preference for political reform [@bolderohiggins2011].

## Proposed Framework

Based on the theory and research reviewed above, we propose the framework of prevention- and promotion-oriented goal pursuit activities presented in Table 1.

```{r table1}
table1 <- read.csv(file="data/RFgoalpursuit_framework.csv", header = TRUE)

table1_print <- kable(table1, "html", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Hypothesized Framework of Prevention versus Promotion Goal Pursuit Activities", align='cc') %>%
  group_rows("Truth-Oriented Activities", 1, 1) %>%
  group_rows("Control-Oriented Activities", 2, 2) %>%
  footnote(general = "For complete lists of the specific activities tested in each study, see the Supplementary Material.", general_title = "Note: ", footnote_as_chunk = T, title_format = c("italic"), threeparttable = TRUE)

table1_print
```

In order to test this framework, we will investigate several hypotheses grounded in basic principles of knowledge activation [@higgins1996] and motivational relevance [@eitamhiggins2010]. First, in order to validate the framework's general applicability, we will examine the availability and accessibility of the predicted associations between the prevention versus promotion systems and the activities in each domain. Higgins [-@higgins1996, p. 134] defines *availability* as "whether or not some particular knowledge is actually stored in memory." If the proposed associations are unavailable to participants, we would not expect to find any consistency in participants' associations between activities in these four domains and the prevention versus promotion systems. Further, he defines *accessibility* as "the activation potential of available knowledge." If the associations between a given activity and regulatory focus are highly accessible, we expect that they will be put to use quickly. Importantly, accessibility is influenced by a range of factors, including frequent and recent priming. Given that our framework comprises everyday goal pursuit activities that are likely to be activated somewhat frequently, if the proposed associations between these activities and regulatory focus are commonly held and fundamental in nature, we expect that participants will endorse them quickly within our studies. Based on this line of thinking, we aimed to test the following two hypotheses:

**Hypothesis 1.** Participants will consistently categorize activities from the proposed framework as reflecting the relevant regulatory focus.

**Hypothesis 2.** Participants will categorize regulatory focus-specific activities from the proposed framework more quickly than more general goal pursuit activities unrelated to the framework.

Further, based on Eitam and Higgins' [@eitamhiggins2010] relevance of a representation (ROAR) framework, we predict that each activity's accessibility to a given participant—and as a result, the degree to which the activity influences the participant's cognition and action—will depend on the motivational relevance of the activity to the participant. Thus, activities associated with the promotion (*vs.* prevention) system will be more accessible to participants with a predominant promotion focus, and the reverse will be true for prevention. Higgins [-@higgins1996] describes two distinct measures of accessibility: *output primacy*, which describes whether a specific construct is recalled first in a given set of responses, and *output frequency*, which describes how frequently a specific construct is recalled in response to questions. Because memory reflects accessibility driven by motivational relevance [@eitametal2013a], the present research operationalizes output primacy as the order in which prevention versus promotion activities are recalled by participants predominant in each regulatory focus. Based on this reasoning, we also aimed to test the following hypothesis:

**Hypothesis 3.** Participants will output motivationally relevant activities (i.e., activities that reflect their own regulatory focus) earlier than activities that are not motivationally relevant.

# The Present Research

To validate the proposed framework and test these hypotheses, we conducted two sets of studies, both of which involved an initial online study followed by a pre-registered replication conducted with a lab sample. In Studies 1A and 1B, after learning about the key differences between promotion and prevention motivation, participants categorized goal pursuit activities based on this distinction. We then tested whether the consistency and speed of participants' categorization decisions reflected our framework of prevention versus promotion goal pursuit activities. Then, in Studies 2A and 2B, we examined how participants' regulatory focus strength—both measured as an individual difference and manipulated experimentally—related to the accessibility of motivationally relevant (*vs.* irrelevant) activities. For each of these studies, we describe the method for determining the final sample size as well as all participant exclusions. Additionally, we report all measures and manipulations. No analyses were conducted until all data for a given study had been collected.

## Exclusion Criteria

Across all studies, given that our hypotheses relate to the subtle connotations of English words, we originally planned to conduct this research with native English speakers. While this criterion was explicitly communicated within the recruitment materials for the online studies (1A and 2A), we were not permitted to limit recruitment based on this criterion in the studies conducted on-campus (1B and 2B). Thus, in all studies, we instituted an exclusion criterion stating that if less than 10% of any given dataset comprised participants who reported not being native English speakers, then we would exclude all non-native English speaking participants. If 10% or more of a given dataset comprised participants who reported not being native English speakers, then we would conduct our analyses both including and excluding the non-native English speaker participants, and would report any differences that emerged. In addition to this language-related exclusion criterion, in all studies, we also excluded any participants who did not complete our independent or dependent measures. Both of these exclusion criteria were detailed in our pre-registration documents for Studies 1B and 2B.

In addition to these pre-registered exclusion criteria, based on a recent rise in the field's awareness of fraudulent responses on online survey platforms [see, for example, @kennedyetal2018], we examined our dataset for responses from participant IP addresses flagged as fraudulent using using `r cite_r(file = "manuscript/rf-activities.bib", pkgs = c("rIP"), withhold = FALSE)`. This flag, which is generated by the an API administered by IPHub.info, indicates participants' use of proxy and virtual private network ("VPN") servers to mask their location. Across our two online studies (1A and 1B), we excluded participants with IP addresses flagged as "Recommend Block" by *rIP* and IPHub.info.

## Analytic Strategy

In order to account for both fixed and random effects within our analyses, we proceeded with a Bayesian approach to multilevel modeling and parameter estimation using `r cite_r(file = "manuscript/rf-activities.bib", pkgs = c("brms"), withhold = FALSE)`. Each of our primary analyses involved a multilevel regression analysis including fixed effects appropriate for the particular study and random effects of both participant and activity. We chose this Bayesian approach for several reasons. The first two reasons are conceptual. Unlike frequentist null hypothesis significance testing, Bayesian approaches provide insight into the uncertainty of model estimates and a distribution of credible parameter values [@kruschke2011]. Further, modeling the goal pursuit activities that we tested as random stimuli reflected our thinking about these activitie:. Although we *do* believe that our proposed activity lists reflect the different kinds of goal pursuit processes motivated by prevention versus promotion, we do *not* claim that these activity lists are comprehensive. For this reason, it is more accurate to treat these activities as a random sample among the many activities associated with prevention versus promotion. The final reason we proceeded with a Bayesian approach was practical, as frequentist models with a complex random effects structure commonly fail to converge, and Bayesian modeling offered a more tractable path forward.

Because the present research reflects the first attempt to study the hypothesized associations between regulatory focus and goal pursuit activities, we chose to proceed with uninformative prior distributions reflecting no prior knowledge for all variables. All analyses were conducted using four Markov chains. We assessed model convergence by ensuring that all R-hat values fell at or below 1.01, and to ensure each model's success in achieving this convergence benchmark, we used between 2000 and 4000 MCMC iterations per chain. In order to draw inferences from these Bayesian multilevel analyses, we followed a common procedure for Bayesian parameter estimation recommended by Kruschke [-@kruschke2011], which involves the examination the 95% credible intervals around the estimated regression coefficients. If this credible interval excluded 0, we concluded that the coefficient reflected an effect of interest. The posterior distributions for all effects of interest, including a visualization of these 95% credible intervals, are provided in the Supplementary Material. Additionally, we only report the fixed effects from these analyses in the main text, as although we were interested in accounting for random effects in our model, we did not have any specific hypotheses about them (e.g., with respect to heterogeneity in our effects). However, the full model output, including both fixed and random effects, are also available in the Supplementary Material.

These models reflect our pre-registered analyses with one important exception and two key additions. The exception relates to the inclusion of specific random effects in the models. We are grateful to a colleague who advised that it is recommended not to include any random effect variables that contain less than six levels; as a result, our models do *not* include random slopes for any variables that fall below this benchmark (e.g., any dummy-coded regulatory focus variables with two levels: promotion *vs.* prevention), which reflects a minor deviation from our pre-registered analysis plan.

Finally, as described in the Exclusion Criteria section, in studies in which greater than 10% of the dataset comprised participants who were not native English speakers, we conducted all analyses with both the full sample as well as with the sample of only native English speakers. Because these results did not differ substantially, we have reported the results of all analyses with the sample of only native English speakers in the Supplementary Material. Additionally, any further study-specific data analysis plans are outlined in the Data Analysis Strategy sections within each study.

## Open Practices

Pre-registrations for our replication studies (Study 1B and 2B) can be found on the Open Science Framework project page associated with the present research: https://osf.io/LINK-TO-BE-ADDED. Further, this project page contains the study materials, data cleaning scripts, analysis scripts, and cleaned and de-identified data associated with all studies.

# Study 1A

In Study 1A, after completing two brief questionnaires probing their chronic motivational orientations, participants learned about the distinction between prevention and promotion motivation. Then, participants completed a sorting task in which they categorized a series of verbs as either prevention or promotion activities. This study provided an initial opportunity to test if participants' categorization decisions reflected our proposed framework. Based on Hypothesis 1, we predicted that participants' categorization decisions would consistently reflect the activities' hypothesized regulatory focus in our framework. Further, based on Hypothesis 2, we predicted that participants would categorize regulatory focus-specific activities from the proposed framework more quickly than more general goal pursuit activities unrelated to the framework. Finally, we also examined whether participants' categorization decisions were predicted by individual differences in participants' own chronic promotion versus prevention focus. Although subsequent studies tested whether participants' regulatory focus influenced the accessibility of *relevant* activities, in Study 1A, we did *not* hypothesize that categorization decisions in general would be influenced by individual differences in participants' regulatory focus.

### Participants.

Although our analytic approach is primarily Bayesian, we conducted a traditional power analysis to determine an appropriate sample size for this first study as, given that this line of work was new, we lacked the prior knowledge needed to confidently proceed with a simulation-based approach. We aimed to detect a medium-to-large odds ratio effect of *OR* = 6 [-@cohen1988] with power of 0.80. This power analysis (G*Power; @fauletal2009; two-tailed; conditional probability that Y = 1 given X = 1 under $H_0$ = 0.5; \( \alpha \) = 0.05; binomial X distribution for which \( \pi \) = 0.5) indicated that 56 participants would be required. In order to account for potential exclusions, we set our target sample size at 75 participants.

Data collection took place in February 2019. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk (“M-Turk”), we recruited 75 native English speaking U.S. workers at least 18 years old. All participants were paid \$2 for their time. Two workers provided the correct code for payment without actually completing the study, leaving a sample of `r (n + blocked + nonenglish)` actual participants. We then examined our dataset for fraudulent responses based on participant IP addresses using `r cite_r(file = "manuscript/rf-activities.bib", pkgs = c("rIP"), withhold = FALSE)`. This review revealed that `r blocked` responses were submitted by IP addresses flagged as fraudulent, so these responses were excluded. Finally, we examined the number of participants who disregarded our recruitment criteria and participated despite their alternate native language. Only `r english(nonenglish)` of the remaining participants reported a native language other than English, and because the percentage of non-native English speaking participants (`r myround(nonenglishpct * 100, digits = 1)`%) fell below our 10% threshold, this participant was excluded from our primary analysis.

These exclusions left a sample of `r n` participants. These participants ranged in age from `r minage` to `r maxage`, with a mean of `r meanage` years old (*SD* = `r sdage`). Participants were `r malepct`% male and `r femalepct`% female (with the remaining participant unspecified). They self-identified as `r whitepct`% White, `r blackpct`% Black, `r asianpct`% Asian, `r hisppct`% Hispanic, and `r multipct`% multiracial, with the remaining participants unspecified.

Finally, per common practice when working with response latency data [e.g., @carpenteretal2019], we excluded observations (i.e., activity categorization decisions) for which the response latency was too short (under 250 ms), thus indicating overly fast responding (i.e. "button mashing"), and too long (over 10,000 ms), indicating a lack of attention. After removing these observations, `r obs` total activity categorization decisions remained, with a mean of `r myround(mean(obsbyn$rfobs), digits = 2)` categorization decisions per participant (*SD* = `r myround(sd(obsbyn$rfobs), digits = 2)`).

### Materials and measures.

#### Preliminary activity list.
To capture the different kinds of goal pursuit activities associated with prevention versus promotion, we aimed to identify actions that people will take to establish what is real and right (i.e., truth-oriented activities) and manage what happens (i.e., control-oriented activities) when motivated by each system. To generate an initial pool of activities, we individually developed lists of verbs for consideration based on extensive conversations about regulatory focus theory and reviews of past empirical work on the unique associations between regulatory focus and variables related to truth and control. We also reviewed several motivational dictionaries that have been developed for use in linguistic analysis, including the regulatory focus dictionary [@gamacheetal2015] and the regulatory mode dictionary [@kanzeetal2019], and appended a range of activities that we considered relevant to the proposed framework. We then expanded on these lists following extensive perusal of a thesaurus, and refined them through ongoing conceptual discussions. The list of prevention-truth activities included behaviors involving careful evaluation and aimed at certainty, such as scrutinize, judge, and verify. The list of prevention-control activities included behaviors involving the vigilant maintenance and protection of a satisfactory status quo, such as defend, preserve, and protect. The list of promotion-truth activities included behaviors involving mental exploration and aimed at knowledge growth and generation, such as imagine, discover, and explore. The list of promotion-control activities included behaviors involving the initiation of forward-directed action aimed at effecting change, such as propel, accelerate, and lead. 

Additionally, in order to distinguish these prevention- and promotion-specific activities from a more general group of truth- and control-oriented actions, we also generated a pool of goal pursuit activities that we hypothesized were *not* associated with the promotion or prevention systems, including general truth activities (e.g., investigate, consider) and control activities (e.g., manage, operate). Finally, using Gamache et al.'s [-@gamacheetal2015] dictionary, we selected six verbs that we believed best reflected the desired end-states of a prevention focus (secure, evade, prevent) versus promotion focus (achieve, gain, grow). Through this process, we generated an initial list of 57 different activities: 34 promotion- and prevention-specific truth- and control-oriented activities; 17 general truth- and control-oriented activities; and 6 activities reflecting the acquisition of promotion- and prevention-specific end-states. For a complete list of these activities, please see the Supplementary Material. Importantly, the regulatory focus of each of the activities hypothesized to relate to regulatory focus was dummy-coded (0 = prevention; 1 = promotion). Based on these hypotheses, we manipulated activity regulatory focus (i.e., our primary independent variable) on a within-participants basis in the activity sorting task described next.

#### Activity sorting task.
Participants categorized each of the verbs in the activity list as prevention or promotion activities within a computerized sorting task administered using JavaScript code embedded within the Qualtrics survey platform. Upon encountering the task, on-screen instructions directed participants to place their left and right index fingers on their E and I keys, respectively. The labels "promotion" and "prevention" were placed at each of the upper corners of the screen. The instructions described that action verbs would appear in the middle of the screen, and that participants should indicate the category to which each verb belongs by pressing the associated key. To balance speed and accuracy concerns, participants were directed to proceed as fast as they can, while making as few mistakes as possible. In all blocks of trials, activities were selected randomly and without replacement until the block's activity list was exhausted. Activities were presented one at a time with an inter-trial interval of 2000 ms. Each activity remained on-screen until the participant's response, and no feedback was provided after any responses. For each trial, the software recorded the activity, the participant's categorization decision, and the participant's response latency in indicating their decision.

The sorting task in Study 1A comprised two groups of trial blocks. In one group of blocks, the "prevention" label was placed in the upper left corner and the "promotion" label was placed in the upper right corner; in the second group, the placement of these labels were reversed. (The placement of these category labels was counterbalanced, such that half of participants were randomly assigned to begin with "prevention" on their left and the other half began with "prevention" on their right.) Each of the two groups consisted of two blocks of trials. The first block was a practice round consisting of six brief trials, in which participants sorted the six activities already known to reflect the acquisition of prevention- and promotion-specific end-states. The second block involved completing 51 additional trials which involved categorizing the remaining 51 activities as prevention or promotion. Upon completing the second block, the position of the labels was reversed and participants completed the second group of trial blocks. Because participants completed the sorting task with the labels in both positions, each participant categorized each activity twice.

```

#### Regulatory focus pride.
To measure chronic historical effectiveness (i.e., “pride”) in the domains of prevention and promotion, we administered the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire ["RFQ"; @higginsetal2001]. The RFQ asks participants to respond on five-point scales (1 = *never or seldom* or *certainly false* to 5 = *very often* or *certainly true*) to eleven items. Five items measure prevention pride (e.g., “Not being careful enough has gotten me into trouble at times”; \( \alpha \) = `r prev.eff_a`) and six items measure promotion pride (e.g., “I feel like I have made progress toward being successful in my life”; \( \alpha \) = `r prom.eff_a`). After mean endorsement levels were determined for each participant ($M_{prevention}$ = `r prev.eff_mean`; $SD_{prevention}$ = `r prev.eff_sd`; $M_{promotion}$ = `r prom.eff_mean`; $SD_{promotion}$ = `r prom.eff_sd`), we calculated promotion (*vs.* prevention) pride dominance scores for use in our primary analysis, as these orientations involve competing motivational preferences. As a result, the predominant regulatory focus score reflects a resultant of the two motivational forces, and we were interested in testing if this resultant predicted participants' categorization decisions. We calculated these dominance scores by subtracting each participant's prevention pride score from his/her promotion pride score (*M* = `r promdom.eff_mean`; *SD* = `r promdom.eff_sd`). Finally, these promotion pride dominance scores were mean-centered for use in our regression analyses so the reference condition for this variable would reflect the typical level of promotion pride dominance among participants. To do so, we subtracted each participant's promotion pride dominance score from the promotion pride dominance grand mean.

```{r s1a_rm}
# Locomotion
loc_mean <- myround(mean(mfraw$loc, na.rm = T), digits = 2)
loc_sd <- myround(sd(mfraw$loc, na.rm = T), digits = 2)
loc <- dplyr::select(mfraw, rmq_1, rmq_3, rmq_4, rmq_5, rmq_8, rmq_16, rmq_21, rmq_25, rmq_28, rmq_29, rmq_13, rmq_24)
loc$rmq_13 <- 7 - loc$rmq_13
loc$rmq_24 <- 7 - loc$rmq_24
loc_a <- psych::alpha(loc)$total$raw_alpha
rm(loc)

# Assessment
ass_mean <- myround(mean(mfraw$ass, na.rm = T), digits = 2)
ass_sd <- myround(sd(mfraw$ass, na.rm = T), digits = 2)
ass <- dplyr::select(mfraw, rmq_2, rmq_6, rmq_7, rmq_9, rmq_10, rmq_11, rmq_15, rmq_19, rmq_20, rmq_22, rmq_27, rmq_30)
ass$rmq_2 <- 7 - ass$rmq_2
ass$rmq_10 <- 7 - ass$rmq_10
ass$rmq_27 <- 7 - ass$rmq_27
ass_a <- psych::alpha(ass)$total$raw_alpha
rm(ass)
```

#### Further measures.
In order to control for any potential effects of stimulus length or frequency of use in the English language, we measured each of these variables for all activities. Length was calculated based on the number of characters in each word. Frequency of use in the English language was taken from each activity's listing in the Corpus of Contemporary American English [@davies2008].

For exploratory purposes, we also measured participants' assessment and locomotion orientations using the Regulatory Mode Questionnaire ["RMQ"; @kruglanskietal2000]. Assessment and locomotion are self-regulatory functions reflecting specific types of truth and control motivation, respectively. Assessment involves the critical evaluation of goals or means, and locomotion involves effecting change through movement from state to state [@kruglanskietal2000; @higginsetal2003]. The RMQ asks participants to respond on six-point scales (1 = *strongly disagree* to 6 = *strongly agree*) to 30 items. Twelve of these items measure locomotion (e.g., “I don't mind doing things even if they involve extra effort”; *M* = `r loc_mean`; *SD* = `r loc_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r loc_a`) and twelve others measure assessment (e.g., “I often critique work done by myself and others”; *M* = `r ass_mean`; *SD* = `r ass_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r ass_a`). Although these data are available within the study dataset provided on the Open Science Framework project page (https://osf.io/LINK-TO-BE-ADDED), they are not discussed further here.

Additionally, we administered four exploratory measures probing participants' experience in completing the activity sorting task. Using a five-point scale (1 = *extremely easy* to 5 = *extremely difficult*), participants indicated, "Overall, how difficult was it to categorize these words as promotion vs. prevention" (*M* = `r myround(mean(mfraw$diff_process, na.rm = T), digits = 2)`; *SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$diff_process, na.rm = T), digits = 2)`). Participants also responded to three open-ended questions: "As best you can, please describe how you made your categorization decisions"; "If you remember any words that were especially difficult to categorize, please list them here"; and "Please enter any additional feedback you'd like to provide here". Although responses to these items are not discussed further here, they are available within the study dataset provided on the Open Science Framework project page.

### Procedure.

After consenting to participate in the study, participants completed two motivational questionnaires: the RFQ and RMQ. Then, participants read that they would learn about two different types of motivation called prevention and promotion. To ensure that participants did not conflate promotion with approach motivation and prevention with avoidance motivation, they were explicitly told that "Both types of motivation want positive, desired outcomes, but the *kinds* of outcomes on which each type of motivation focuses are different." They learned that prevention is a type of motivation focused on desired outcomes like safety and security, whereas promotion focuses on desired outcomes like achievement and growth. Further, they learned that prevention-focused people prefer to avoid losses, put themselves in situations where they will not lose, and maintain a current satisfactory status quo to avoid worse states. Promotion-focused people prefer to pursue gains, avoid situations where they will not gain, and change the status quo in order to attain a better state. Finally, they learned that people strongly motivated by prevention are focused on the positive things they ought to do in a given situation, so they tend to pursue their goals vigilantly; in contrast, people strongly motivated by promotion are focused on the positive things they would ideally like to do in a given situation, so they tend to pursue their goals eagerly.

After learning these distinctions between prevention and promotion, participants proceeded to the activity sorting task described above. Between each block of trials, the prevention-promotion distinctions first encountered in the initial training were presented again to refresh participants' memories. Finally, after finishing the sorting task, participants completed the exploratory items intended to probe their categorization experience. Participants then optionally provided demographic information and were debriefed, thanked, and compensated.

## Results

### Data analysis strategy.
Our primary analysis examined whether our predictions about the hypothesized regulatory focus of each prevention or promotion activity were reflected in participants' categorization decisions about these activities. We selected the subset of the data comprising only activities we hypothesized reflected prevention or promotion (*N* = `r nrow(rftest_rmf)`) and analyzed these data within a Bayesian multilevel binomial logistic regression model. Participants' categorization decisions (i.e., our primary dependent variable) were dummy-coded for this analysis (0 = prevention; 1 = promotion), and the same coding scheme was applied to the hypothesized regulatory focus of each activity (i.e., our primary independent variable). The model also included promotion (*vs.* prevention) pride dominance as a covariate, as we were also interested in testing if categorization decisions were associated with chronic individual differences in regulatory focus. Other covariates included as fixed effects were the initial placement of the category names (effect-coded: -0.5 = right; 0.5 = left), as well as trial, activity frequency, and activity length (all rescaled: *M* = 0; *SD* = 1). Random effects included in the model were random intercepts of participant and activity; random slopes of trial, activity frequency, and activity length by participant; and random slopes of promotion pride dominance by activity.

Our secondary analysis tested whether verbs that we hypothesized were prevention- or promotion-specific activities were categorized more quickly than verbs that we hypothesized were general activities. To conduct this analysis, we analyzed all activity categorization decisions (*N* = `r nrow(rftest)`) within a Bayesian multilevel multiple regression model. Participants' response latencies for each categorization decision were log-transformed to normalize the distribution. Then, these log-transformed response latencies were regressed on a dummy-coded variable capturing whether or not each activity was hypothesized to reflect a specific regulatory focus (0 = *not* a prevention or promotion activity, 1 = prevention or promotion activity). Like our primary analysis, this model also included the following covariates: promotion (*vs.* prevention) pride dominance; the initial placement of the category names (effect-coded: -0.5 = right; 0.5 = left); and trial, activity frequency, and activity length (all rescaled: *M* = 0; *SD* = 1). Random effects included in the model were random intercepts of participant and activity; random slopes of trial, activity frequency, and activity length by participant; and random slopes of promotion pride dominance by activity.

Additionally, we visually examined the consistency and speed of participants' categorization decisions about each activity in Study 1A in order to refine the activity list. In doing so, we aimed to develop a final pool of 24 activities, with six per category (prevention-truth; prevention-control; promotion-truth; promotion-control). We also used the activity length and frequency information to ensure that these four groups did not significantly differ on these dimensions. After making these list refinements, we re-conducted our primary and secondary analyses using this refined activity list.

```

### Activity categorization decisions.
Among all categorization decisions (i.e., for all activities), on average, `r myround((1 - mean(rftest$rfcat.d)) * 100, digits = 2)`% of activities were categorized as prevention and `r myround((mean(rftest$rfcat.d)) * 100, digits = 2)`% of activities were categorized as promotion. Among the decisions made with respect to our proposed list of prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit activities, a similar pattern emerged: an average of `r myround((1 - mean(rftest_rmf$rfcat.d)) * 100, digits = 2)`% of activities were categorized as prevention and `r myround((mean(rftest_rmf$rfcat.d)) * 100, digits = 2)`% of activities were categorized as promotion. By estimating the intercept within a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression model including a fixed intercept as well as random intercepts of participant and activity, we determined that the probability of categorizing our hypothesized regulatory focus-specific activities as promotion (log odds of 0.15 units; 95% CI: -0.43, 0.73); probability of `r myround(invlog(0.15) * 100, digits = 2)`%; 95% CI: `r myround(invlog(-.43) * 100, digits = 2)`%, `r myround(invlog(0.73) * 100, digits = 2)`%) did not differ significantly from chance (i.e., a probability of 0.5).

### Activity categorization response latency.
Among all categorization decisions (i.e., for all activities), on average, activities were categorized in `r myround(mean(rftest$rfrt) / 1000, digits = 2)` seconds, and our hypothesized list of prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit activities were categorized in `r myround(mean(rftest_rmf$rfrt) / 1000, digits = 2)` seconds.

### Primary analysis: Do our hypotheses about whether each activity reflects a promotion (*vs.* prevention) focus predict participants' categorization decisions?

```

To test if our hypotheses about the activities' regulatory focus predicted participants' categorization decisions, we examined the model output from our Bayesian multilevel logistic regression analysis (see the upper panel of Table 2 and Figure 1). The estimated effect of hypothesized activity regulatory focus was `r beff(table2[2, "Estimate"])` log odds units, with a 95% credible interval that did not include zero (`r beff(table2[2, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table2[2, "Upper"])`). This credible interval suggests that there is an association between our hypotheses about the prevention versus promotion focus of activities and participants' categorization decisions. Transformed into probabilities, the model predicts that activities that we hypothesized were associated with prevention had a `r round(100 - invlog(-1.06)*100, digits = 2)`% probability of being categorized as prevention, and activities that we hypothesized were associated with promotion had a `r round(invlog(-1.06 + 2.82)*100, digits = 2)`% probability of being categorized as promotion.

Additionally, this analysis allowed us to test if participants' categorization of any given stimulus as promotion or prevention is a function of the participant's promotion (*vs.* prevention) pride dominance. As indicated in the upper panel of Table 2, the estimated effect of promotion pride dominance on activity categorization is `r beff(table2[3, "Estimate"])`, with a 95% credible interval that includes zero (`r beff(table2[3, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table2[3, "Upper"])`). This credible interval indicates that we cannot infer any association between individual differences in promotion pride dominance and participants' categorization decisions. Further, no other fixed effects in this primary analysis had a credible interval excluding zero.

### Secondary analysis: Are activities hypothesized to be associated with a specific regulatory focus categorized more quickly than activities without these hypothesized associations?

To test if our hypotheses about the activities' associations with regulatory focus (or not) predicted how quickly participants made their categorization decisions, we examined the model output from our Bayesian multilevel multiple regression analysis (see the bolded line in the lower panel of Table 2). The estimated effect of this hypothesized association with regulatory focus is `r beff(table2[9, "Estimate"])` log-transformed milliseconds, with a 95% credible interval that did not include zero (`r beff(table2[9, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table2[9, "Upper"])`). These results suggest that participants were quicker in categorizing categorized activities that we hypothesized were (*vs.* were not) associated with a specific regulatory focus. The model predicts that activities that we hypothesized were associated with a specific regulatory focus would be categorized in `r myround(exp(as.numeric(beff(table2[8, "Estimate"])) + as.numeric(beff(table2[9, "Estimate"]))) / 1000, digits = 2)` seconds, and activities that we hypothesized were *not* associated with a specific regulatory focus would be categorized in `r myround(exp(as.numeric(beff(table2[8, "Estimate"]))) / 1000, digits = 2)` seconds.

Additionally, this analysis allowed us to test if participants' response latencies in categorizing these stimuli were associated with their promotion (*vs.* prevention) pride dominance. As indicated in the lower panel of Table 2, the estimated effect of promotion pride dominance is `r beff(table2[10, "Estimate"])`, with a 95% credible interval that includes zero (`r beff(table2[10, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table2[10, "Upper"])`). These results suggest no association between individual differences in promotion pride dominance and participants' categorization speed. Notably, several of our covariates were associated with participants' response latency, including trial (such that participants' categorization speed increased over the course of the study) and activities' frequency of use in the English language (such that more frequently used words were categorized more quickly).

Although the analyses above provided initial support for our proposed framework, given that this study represented our first thorough investigation on this topic, we were interested in refining the activity lists based on these results. We intended to develop a slightly condensed set of activities with an equal number of activities per category and, in doing so, we ensured that both activity length and frequency of use in the English language did not differ among the categories. To accomplish these aims, we engaged in a number of conceptual discussions about the activity categories, informed by a thorough visual inspection of participants' categorization decisions and response latencies by activity.

Through this process, we determined a final list of 24 prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit activities. Prevention activities included six prevention-truth activities (assess, examine, judge, review, scrutinize, verify) and six prevention-control activities (defend, guard, maintain, preserve, protect, resist). Promotion activities included six promotion-truth activities (discover, explore, imagine, invent, seek, wonder) and six promotion-truth activities (accelerate, elevate, launch, lead, progress, propel). We also used the activity length and frequency information to ensure that the groups did not significantly differ on these dimensions. We then re-conducted our primary and secondary analyses using this refined activity list to confirm that none of our key findings changed. (A visualization of the activity selections can also be found in Figure 2.)

### Primary analysis with refined activity list: Do our hypotheses about whether each activity reflects a promotion (*vs.* prevention) focus predict participants' categorization decisions?

To test if our hypothesis about the refined set of activities' regulatory focus predicted participants' own categorization decisions, we examined the model output from a second Bayesian multilevel logistic regression analysis (see the bolded line in the upper panel of Table 3 and Figure 1). The estimated effect of hypothesized activity regulatory focus is `r beff(table3[2, "Estimate"])` log odds units, with a 95% credible interval that did not include zero (`r beff(table3[2, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table3[2, "Upper"])`). In line with Hypothesis 1, this credible interval indicates an association between the proposed regulatory focus of this refined set of activities and participants' categorization decisions. Additionally, like in our analysis conducted with the original set of activities, this analysis did not indicate an effect of promotion pride dominance on activity categorization is `r beff(table3[3, "Estimate"])` (95% CI: `r beff(table3[3, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table3[3, "Upper"])`), and the credible intervals of all other fixed effects also included zero.

### Secondary analysis with refined activity list: Do our hypotheses about whether each activity reflects a specific regulatory focus (or not) predict participants' response latencies in categorizing the activities?

To examine how the refined set of activities' associations with regulatory focus (or not) predicted the speed of participants' categorization decisions, we examined the model output from a second Bayesian multilevel multiple regression analysis (see the bolded line in the lower panel of Table 3). The estimated effect of this hypothesized association with regulatory focus is `r beff(table3[9, "Estimate"])` log-transformed milliseconds, with a 95% credible interval that did not include zero (`r beff(table3[9, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table3[9, "Upper"])`). These results provide support for Hypothesis 2, indicating that participants were quicker in categorizing activities that we hypothesized were (*vs.* were not) associated with a specific regulatory focus. The model predicts that activities that we hypothesized were associated with a specific regulatory focus would be categorized in `r myround(exp(as.numeric(beff(table3[8, "Estimate"])) + as.numeric(beff(table3[9, "Estimate"]))) / 1000, digits = 2)` seconds, and activities that we hypothesized were *not* associated with a specific regulatory focus would be categorized in `r myround(exp(as.numeric(beff(table3[8, "Estimate"]))) / 1000, digits = 2)` seconds. Additionally, as in our original set of analyses, participants' response latencies were not associated with their promotion (*vs.* prevention) pride dominance, and further, several covariates were associated with participants' response latency, including trial and activities' frequency of use in the English language.

## Discussion

In Study 1A, we obtained initial evidence for our proposed framework of prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit activities. By training participants on the primary distinctions between prevention and promotion and asking participants to categorize a series of activities on this basis, we were able to confirm that participants' associations between these activities and regulatory focus reflected our framework. Notably, these categorization decisions were not influenced by participants' own promotion (*vs.* prevention) pride dominance. This result is important because it could have been possible that participants would associate all activities with their predominant regulatory focus (e.g., if Alicia is chronically promotion-dominant, she will tend to see all goal pursuit activities as involving a promotion focus). However, this is not the pattern of results we found; instead, no effect of promotion pride dominance was detected. This finding suggests that these associations are commonly understood.

Further, participants categorized activities that we hypothesized related to regulatory focus more quickly than the general truth- and control-oriented activities we hypothesized were *un*related to regulatory focus. This response latency measure provides insight into the accessibility of these associations, reflecting that participants pause slightly when considering how to categorize activities that do not seem to clearly "fit" with a given regulatory focus. These results indicate that the associations between the constructs of prevention and promotion and the hypothesized list of prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit activities are more accessible than the associations between the same constructs and more general goal pursuit activities. Together with the results of participants' categorization decisions, these findings supported Hypotheses 1 and 2, providing early support for our proposed framework. As a next step, we were interested in testing the generalizability of these initial findings.

# Study 1B

Study 1B aimed to replicate the findings of Study 1A and provide further evidence in support of Hypotheses 1 and 2 within a pre-registered lab study conducted on-campus with a student population. By testing the framework with a sample that varied substantially from the online sample in Study 1A on a number of dimensions, including age, education, and ethnicity, we sought to investigate whether the associations between regulatory focus and our list of prevention versus promotion goal pursuit activities remained consistent among this different population.

### Participants.

In order to determine the sample size for this study, we used `r cite_r(file = NULL)` to conduct a Bayesian equivalent of a power analysis following a simulation-based approach recommended by Kurz [-@kurz2019]. Given that the effects we planned to analyze in an exploratory analysis not reported here may have been smaller than the effects found in Study 1A, our goal was to obtain power of 0.90 to detect an odds ratio effect of *OR* = 1.50 at \( \alpha \) = 0.05. Our target sample size was 75 participants, and in order to account for potential exclusions, we aimed to recruit 100 participants. We also pre-registered a stopping rule indicating that if we had collected data from at least 75 participants by the end of the Fall 2019 semester, despite not reaching the total sample size of 100, we would terminate data collection and proceed to data analysis.

Data collection took place between October 2019 and March 2020. Participants were undergraduate students at least 18 years old at a university in the northeastern U.S. who completed the study for course credit. Although our pre-registration included a stopping rule of 75 participants, given the Covid-19 pandemic, data collection ended with a hiatus on human subjects research mandated by the university in March 2020. As a result, Study 1B includes data from the `r n` students who were recruited prior to this hiatus. Participants ranged in age from `r minage` to `r maxage`, with a mean of `r meanage` years old (*SD* = `r sdage`). Participants were `r malepct`% male and `r femalepct`% female (with two participants unspecified). Participants self-identified as `r whitepct`% White, `r asianpct`% Asian, `r multipct`% multiracial, `r hisppct`% Hispanic, and `r blackpct`% Black, with the remaining participants unspecified.

Per our pre-defined exclusion criteria, we examined the number of participants who responded that they were not native English speakers, as if this number fell below 10%, we would have excluded this group. Because `r nonenglish` of our `r n` participants (`r myround(nonenglishpct * 100, digits = 1)`%) reported a native language other than English, these participants were *not* excluded from our primary analyses. As described in the study's pre-registration, we also conducted all analyses excluding this group and noted very similar results; please see the Supplementary Material for the results of all analyses conducted with this smaller sample.

As in Study 1A, we excluded observations (i.e., activity categorization decisions) for which the response latency was less than 250 ms or greater than 10,000 ms. After removing these observations, our dataset included `r obs` total activity categorization decisions, with a mean of `r myround(mean(obsbyn$rfobs), digits = 2)` categorization decisions per participant (*SD* = `r myround(sd(obsbyn$rfobs), digits = 2)`).

### Materials and measures.

#### Activity list.

In Study 1B, the activity list comprised 39 activities in total. Among these activities, 36 were drawn from the activity list used in Study 1A, including the 24 promotion- and prevention-specific goal pursuit activities adopted from the refined activity list, six general truth- and control-oriented activities, and six activities reflecting the acquisition of promotion- and prevention-specific end-states. Additionally, three more general activities (sleep, shower, communicate) were included. For a complete list of these activities, please see the Supplementary Material. As in Study 1A, the regulatory focus of each of these activities was dummy-coded (0 = prevention; 1 = promotion). Based on these hypotheses, we manipulated activity regulatory focus (i.e., our primary independent variable) on a within-participants basis in the activity sorting task described next.

#### Activity sorting task.
Participants categorized each of the verbs in the activity list as prevention or promotion activities within a computerized sorting task very similar to the task administered in Study 1A, with some minor changes. Given some feedback from participants that the sorting task in Study 1A could have been administered more quickly, in Study 1B, the inter-trial interval was set to 1000 ms. Additionally, the sorting task in Study 1B only comprised one group of trial blocks, rather than two. Like in Study 1A, when participants began the sorting task, the the placement of the "prevention" and "promotion" category labels was counterbalanced; however, given that this study only contained one group of trial blocks, this randomly assigned category placement did not change midway through the task. Finally, the number of trials was significantly reduced, as a result of the smaller activity list and the inclusion of only one group of trial blocks. After the first practice block consisting of six trials, the second block involved categorizing the remaining 33 activities as prevention or promotion.

Additionally, for exploratory purposes, participants performed a second activity sorting task in which they were asked to categorize activities as reflecting truth versus control motivation, rather than prevention versus promotion. The results of this exploratory task are not discussed further here.

```

#### Regulatory focus pride.
As in Study 1A, to measure chronic historical effectiveness (i.e., “pride”) in the domains of prevention and promotion, we administered the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire ["RFQ"; @higginsetal2001]. After mean endorsement levels were determined for each participant ($M_{prevention}$ = `r prev.eff_mean`; $SD_{prevention}$ = `r prev.eff_sd`; $\alpha_{prevention}$ = `r prev.eff_a`; $M_{promotion}$ = `r prom.eff_mean`; $SD_{promotion}$ = `r prom.eff_sd`; $\alpha_{promotion}$ = `r prom.eff_a`), we calculated promotion (*vs.* prevention) pride dominance scores for use in our primary analysis by subtracting each participant's prevention pride score from his/her promotion pride score (*M* = `r promdom.eff_mean`; *SD* = `r promdom.eff_sd`). Finally, these promotion pride dominance scores were mean-centered for use in our regression analyses by subtracting each participant's promotion pride dominance score from the promotion pride dominance grand mean.

rm(ass)
```

#### Further measures.
The only new measure administered in Study 1B was the Regulatory Focus Strength measure [@higginsetal1997], which was included for exploratory purposes. Whereas the RFQ assesses participants chronic historical effectiveness (i.e., pride) in the domains of prevention and promotion, the Regulatory Focus Strength measure is an idiographic measure that captures the accessibility of participants' ought (i.e., prevention) versus ideal (i.e., promotion) goals. Participants are asked to list four attributes that describe each of these types of goals in a pseudo-random order, and the computer captures their response latency in submitting these goals. Further, participants are asked to rate the degree to which they ideally would possess or ought to possess the attribute, as well as the degree to which they actually possess the attribute, on a four-point scale (1 = *slightly* to 4 = *extremely*). Their response latencies are also captured when making these ratings. Following the standard procedure of Higgins, Shah, and Friedman [-@higginsetal1997], these response latencies are log-transformed to normalize the distributions. Then, prevention and promotion strength scores are calculated by summing the nine log-transformed response latencies associated with the first three oughts (\( \alpha \) = `r prev.str_a`) and first three ideals (\( \alpha \) = `r prom.str_a`), respectively. Finally, these scores are multiplied by -1 so that higher scores indicate greater strength ($M_{prevention}$ = `r prev.str_mean`; $SD_{prevention}$ = `r prev.str_sd`; $M_{promotion}$ = `r prom.str_mean`; $SD_{promotion}$ = `r prom.str_sd`). Although the data from this measure are available within the study dataset provided on the Open Science Framework project page (https://osf.io/LINK-TO-BE-ADDED), they are not discussed further here.

Like in Study 1A, in order to control for any potential effects of stimulus length or frequency of use in the English language, we measured each of these variables for all activities. We also measured participants' assessment (*M* = `r ass_mean`; *SD* = `r ass_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r ass_a`) and locomotion (*M* = `r loc_mean`; *SD* = `r loc_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r loc_a`) orientations using the RMQ [@kruglanskietal2000]. Although these data are available within the study dataset provided on the Open Science Framework project page, they are not discussed further here.

Finally, we also administered the same exploratory measures probing participants' experience in completing the prevention versus promotion activity sorting task as in Study 1A. Additionally, participants completed a second set of questions that asked about their experience in completing the exploratory truth versus control activity sorting task. Although responses to these items are not discussed further here, they are available within the study dataset provided on the Open Science Framework project page.

### Procedure.

After consenting to participate in the study, participants completed three motivational measures: the Regulatory Focus Strength measure, the RMQ, and the RFQ. Then, after learning about the distinction between prevention and promotion motivation based on the same training administered in Study 1A, participants completed the prevention versus promotion activity sorting task. After this task, they completed a similar exploratory activity sorting task in which they categorized the verbs based on their associations with truth versus control. Finally, after finishing these sorting tasks, participants completed the exploratory items intended to probe their categorization experience. After optionally providing brief demographic information, participants were debriefed, thanked, and compensated.

## Results

### Data analysis strategy.
As in Study 1A, our primary analysis examined whether our predictions about the hypothesized regulatory focus of each prevention or promotion activity were reflected in participants' categorization decisions. To conduct this analysis, we selected the subset of the data comprising only activities we hypothesized reflected prevention or promotion (*N* = `r nrow(rftest_rmf)`) and analyzed these data within a Bayesian multilevel binomial logistic regression model specified identically to the model in Study 1A. Further, our secondary analysis was consistent with Study 1A, testing whether verbs that we hypothesized were prevention- or promotion-specific activities were categorized more quickly than verbs that we hypothesized were general activities. To conduct this analysis, we analyzed all activity categorization decisions (*N* = `r nrow(rftest)`) within a Bayesian multilevel multiple regression model identical to the model specified in Study 1A.

``` {r s1b_rfcat_overall}
# Bayesian logistic regression with random intercepts for each stimulus and participant (commented out after initial analysis, as code takes a while to run; to re-run, un-comment the following three lines)
# set.seed(1234)
# mlmrfcatb_1b_overall <- brm(rfcat.d ~ 1 + (1 | id) + (1 | stim), family = binomial, data = rftest_rmf, cores = 4, chains = 4, iter = 3000, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95))
# save(mlmrfcatb_1b_overall, file = "models/mlmrfcatb_1b_overall.rda")
load("models/mlmrfcatb_1b_overall.rda")
# summary(mlmrfcatb_1b_overall)
```

### Activity categorization decisions.
Among all activity categorization decisions (i.e., for all activities), on average, `r myround((1 - mean(rftest$rfcat.d)) * 100, digits = 2)`% of activities were categorized as prevention and `r myround((mean(rftest$rfcat.d)) * 100, digits = 2)`% of activities were categorized as promotion. Among the decisions made with respect to our proposed list of prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit activities, a similar pattern emerged: an average of `r myround((1 - mean(rftest_rmf$rfcat.d)) * 100, digits = 2)`% of activities were categorized as prevention and `r myround((mean(rftest_rmf$rfcat.d)) * 100, digits = 2)`% of activities were categorized as promotion. By estimating the intercept within a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression model including a fixed intercept as well as random intercepts of participant and activity, we determined that the probability of categorizing our hypothesized regulatory focus-specific activities as promotion (log odds of 0.99 units; 95% CI: -0.72, 2.70; probability of `r myround(invlog(0.99) * 100, digits = 2)`%; 95% CI: `r myround(invlog(-.72) * 100, digits = 2)`%, `r myround(invlog(2.70) * 100, digits = 2)`%) did not differ significantly from chance (i.e., a probability of 0.5).

### Activity categorization response latency.
Among all decisions made (i.e., for all activities), on average, activities were categorized in `r myround(mean(rftest$rfrt) / 1000, digits = 2)` seconds, and our hypothesized list of prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit activities were categorized in `r myround(mean(rftest_rmf$rfrt) / 1000, digits = 2)` seconds.

### Primary analysis: Do our hypotheses about whether each activity reflects a promotion (*vs.* prevention) focus predict participants' categorization decisions?

To test if our hypotheses about the activities' regulatory focus predicted participants' own categorization decisions, we examined the model output from our Bayesian multilevel logistic regression analysis (see the upper panel of Table 4 and Figure 3). The estimated effect of hypothesized activity regulatory focus was `r beff(table4[2, "Estimate"])` log odds units, with a 95% credible interval that did not include zero (`r beff(table4[2, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table4[2, "Upper"])`). In line with Hypothesis 1, this credible interval suggests that there is an association between the promotion versus prevention focus of the activities and participants' categorization decisions. Transformed into probabilities, the model predicts that activities that we hypothesized were associated with prevention had a `r round(100 - invlog(-2.65)*100, digits = 2)`% probability of being categorized as prevention, and activities that we hypothesized were associated with promotion had a `r round(invlog(-2.65 + 	7.76)*100, digits = 2)`% probability of being categorized as promotion.

Additionally, like in Study 1A, we were interested in examining whether participants' categorization of any given stimulus as promotion or prevention was associated with their promotion (*vs.* prevention) pride dominance. As indicated in the upper panel of Table 4, the estimated effect of promotion pride dominance on activity categorization is `r beff(table4[3, "Estimate"])`, with a 95% credible interval that includes zero (`r beff(table4[3, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table4[3, "Upper"])`). This credible interval indicates that we cannot infer any association between individual differences in promotion pride dominance and participants' categorization decisions. Further, no other fixed effects in this primary analysis had a credible interval excluding zero.

```{r table4_print, include = TRUE, results = 'asis'}

```

### Secondary analysis: Are activities hypothesized to be associated with a specific regulatory focus categorized more quickly than activities without these hypothesized associations?

To test if our hypotheses about the activities' associations with regulatory focus (or not) predicted how quickly participants made their categorization decisions, we examined the model output from our Bayesian multilevel multiple regression analysis (see the bolded line in the lower panel of Table 4). The estimated effect of this hypothesized association with regulatory focus is `r beff(table4[9, "Estimate"])` log-transformed milliseconds, with a 95% credible interval that did not include zero (`r beff(table4[9, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table4[9, "Upper"])`). In line with Hypothesis 2, these results suggest that participants were quicker to categorize activities that we hypothesized were (*vs.* were not) associated with a specific regulatory focus. The model predicts that activities that we hypothesized were associated with a specific regulatory focus would be categorized in `r myround(exp(as.numeric(beff(table4[8, "Estimate"])) + as.numeric(beff(table4[9, "Estimate"]))) / 1000, digits = 2)` seconds, and activities that we hypothesized were *not* associated with a specific regulatory focus would be categorized in `r myround(exp(as.numeric(beff(table4[8, "Estimate"]))) / 1000, digits = 2)` seconds. To visualize these differences in response latency as well as activity categorization, see Figure 4.

```{r fig4, include = TRUE, fig.cap = "(ref:fig4cap)", fig.align = "center", out.width = '90%', out.height = '90%'}
fig4
```

Additionally, this analysis allowed us to test if participants' response latencies in categorizing these stimuli were associated with their promotion (*vs.* prevention) pride dominance. As indicated in the lower panel of Table 4, the estimated effect of promotion pride dominance is `r beff(table4[10, "Estimate"])`, with a 95% credible interval that includes zero (`r beff(table4[10, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table4[10, "Upper"])`). These results suggest no association between individual differences in promotion pride dominance and participants' categorization speed. Like in Study 1A, trial was also associated with participants' response latency; however, whereas activities' frequency of use in the English language was associated with faster predictions in Study 1A, we did not detect such an effect in Study 1B.

## Discussion

Study 1B provided additional evidence in support of Hypotheses 1 and 2 as well as our proposed framework of prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit activities. The results were highly consistent with the results of Study 1A, indicating that (a) participants' categorization decisions reflected our framework, (b) participants categorized activities that we hypothesized related to regulatory focus more quickly than the general truth- and control-oriented activities we hypothesized were *un*related to regulatory focus, and (c) individual differences in promotion pride dominance had no effect in these models.

Collectively, the results of Studies 1A and 1B indicate that the associations between regulatory focus and the hypothesized list of prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit activities are highly accessible and commonly available among samples including university students and M-Turk workers. These findings suggest that these associations may be fundamental in nature. As a next step, we were interested in testing Eitam and Higgins' [-@eitamhiggins2010] proposal that the accessibility of a representation is influenced by its motivational relevance (Hypothesis 3). For example, if the activity of "scrutinize" is fundamentally associated with the prevention system, will it be more accessible to a person strongly (*vs.* weakly) motivated by prevention? As described briefly earlier, in Studies 2A and 2B, we operationalized accessibility as activities' output primacy [@higgins1996] within an unaided recall task. Study 2A examined how output primacy related to the interaction between *measured* regulatory focus strength and motivationally relevant (*vs.* irrelevant) activities, and Study 2B examined how *manipulated* regulatory focus strength influenced the output primacy of motivationally relevant (*vs.* irrelevant) activities.

# Study 2A

Study 2A served as our first investigation of Hypothesis 3. Specifically, the study aimed to test whether the associations between the prevention and promotion systems and various goal pursuit activities extend to the accessibility of these activities for a given individual. After completing three measures examining their chronic motivational orientations, participants were presented with 36 different goal pursuit activities and asked to rate their importance. Then, following a brief distraction, participants were surprised with an unaided recall task in which they were asked to list as many of the activities rated earlier as possible. We then examined the order in which they recalled these activities ("output rank") as our primary dependent measure. We hypothesized that participants' regulatory focus strength would interact with activity regulatory focus to predict output rank, such that participants with stronger (*vs.* weaker) promotion strength would tend to output promotion (*vs.* prevention) activities earlier in their lists, and that participants with stronger (*vs.* weaker) prevention strength would tend to output prevention (*vs.* promotion) activities earlier.

### Participants.

Similar to Study 1A, although our analytic approach is primarily Bayesian, we conducted a traditional power analysis to determine an appropriate sample size for this first study as, given the novelty of this research, we lacked the prior knowledge needed to appropriately proceed with a simulation-based approach. We aimed to detect a medium effect of $f^2$ = 0.15 [@cohen1988] with power of 0.80. This power analysis (G*Power; @fauletal2009; \( \alpha \) = 0.05; testing one of six total predictors) indicated that 55 participants would be required. In order to account for potential exclusions, we set our target sample size at 75 participants.

Data collection took place in July 2019. We recruited 75 native English speaking U.S. M-Turk workers at least 18 years old. All participants were paid \$1.75 for their time. As in Study 1A, we examined our dataset for fraudulent responses based on participant IP addresses using `r cite_r(file = "manuscript/rf-activities.bib", pkgs = c("rIP"), withhold = FALSE)`. This review revealed that `r english(blocked)` responses were submitted by IP addresses flagged as fraudulent, so these responses were excluded. Additionally, we examined the number of participants who disregarded our recruitment criteria and participated despite *not* being native English speakers. Only `r english(nonenglish)` of the remaining participants reported a native language other than English, and because the percentage of non-native English speaking participants (`r myround(nonenglishpct * 100, digits = 1)`%) fell below our 10% threshold, this participant was excluded from our primary analysis.

Among the remaining `r 75 - blocked - nonenglish` participants, `r english(improper_rfs + missing_rfs)` participants failed to properly complete the measure that collected our primary predictor variables (Regulatory Focus Strength), and `r english(nomem_mot)` participants failed to recall any activities from our framework at the end of the study (i.e., our primary dependent variable). These exclusions left a sample of `r n` participants. These participants ranged in age from `r minage` to `r maxage`, with a mean of `r meanage` years old (*SD* = `r sdage`). Participants were `r malepct`% male and `r femalepct`% female. They self-identified as `r whitepct`% White, `r asianpct`% Asian, `r blackpct`% Black, `r hisppct`% Hispanic, and `r multipct`% multiracial.

```{r s2a_subsets}
# Data for 24 stimuli of interest for participants who remembered at least one promotion word and one prevention word
mf.rmf.memboth <- mf.rmf %>%
  filter(!is.na(logmemrank_promdom))

# Determine number of observations and participants in "memboth" group
obs_memboth <- nrow(mf.rmf.memboth) # 221
n_memboth <- length(unique(mf.rmf.memboth$id)) # n = 41

# Data for 24 stimuli of interest with first 13 remembered activities (mean # of remembered activities)
mf.rmf.f13 <- mf.rmf %>%
  filter(memrank >= -13)
```

The dataset included `r obs` total recalled activities from our hypothesized framework. Among the sample of participants who recalled at least one of the 24 promotion and prevention goal pursuit activities, the number of activities recalled ranged from `r min(obsbyn$rfobs)` to `r max(obsbyn$rfobs)` ($M$ = `r myround(mean(obsbyn$rfobs), digits = 2)`, $SD$ = `r myround(sd(obsbyn$rfobs), digits = 2)`). For exploratory purposes, we also conducted our primary analysis on a subset of the data including only the `r n_memboth` participants who recalled at least one promotion activity *and* one prevention activity (total number of recalled activities among this group = `r obs_memboth`). The results of this exploratory analysis can be found in the Supplementary Material.

```

#### Regulatory focus strength.
Promotion and prevention strength were assessed using the same idiographic, response latency-based Regulatory Focus Strength measure [@higginsetal1997] administered in Study 1B ($M_{prevention}$ = `r prev.str_mean`; $SD_{prevention}$ = `r prev.str_sd`; $\alpha_{prevention}$ = `r prev.str_a`; $M_{promotion}$ = `r prom.str_mean`; $SD_{promotion}$ = `r prom.str_sd`; $\alpha_{promotion}$ = `r prom.str_a`). We then calculated promotion (*vs.* prevention) strength dominance scores, as like promotion and prevention pride, these orientations involve different motivational preferences and, as a result, competing accessibility effects. We calculated these dominance scores by subtracting each participant's prevention pride score from his/her promotion pride score (*M* = `r promdom.str_mean`; *SD* = `r promdom.str_sd`). Finally, these promotion strength dominance scores were mean-centered for use in our regression analyses so the reference condition for this variable would reflect the typical level of promotion strength dominance among participants. To do so, we subtracted each participant's promotion strength dominance score from the promotion strength dominance grand mean.

Additionally, for the purposes of exploratory analysis, participants' promotion and prevention strength scores were mean-centered so the reference condition for this variable would reflect the typical level of promotion pride dominance among participants. To do so, we subtracted each participant's promotion pride dominance score from the promotion pride dominance grand mean. We also scaled these mean-centered scores such that *SD* = 1. The results of exploratory analyses using these scores (rather than the dominance score) were quite similar to the results of our analyses using dominance scores (see Supplementary Material).

#### Activity list.

In Study 2A, the activity list comprised 36 activities in total. Among these activities, 36 reflected the activity list refined in Study 1A and used in Study 1B, including the same 24 promotion- and prevention-specific goal pursuit activities and six general truth- and control-oriented activities. (No activities reflecting the acquisition of promotion- and prevention-specific end-states were included, as these activities were included in Studies 1A and 1B for the sake of the practice round in the sorting task, and Study 2A involved no such task.) Additionally, in addition to the three general activities included in the activity list used in Study 1B, three more general activities (exercise, read, pray) were included to help ensure that the study's activity importance rating task felt like a comprehensive review of all kinds of everyday activities. For a complete list of these activities, please see the Supplementary Material. Most relevant to our investigation were the 12 activities hypothesized to relate to prevention and the 12 activities hypothesized to relate to promotion. The regulatory focus of each of these activities was then effect-coded (-0.5 = prevention; 0.5 = promotion) and manipulated on a within-participants basis in the activity importance rating task described next.

#### Activity importance rating task.
In order to present all 36 activities to participants a first time, participants were asked to rate the importance of these activities in an importance rating task. Instructions described that the research team was interested in how important participants considered it to be that they engaged in each activity in their own lives. Each activity was presented and rated on a separate page of the questionnaire, which facilitated the collection of activity-specific response latency data for exploratory purposes. Participants responded to the question "How important is it that you engage in this activity?" on a 101-point sliding scale (0 = *not at all important* to 5 = *extremely important*). Activities were presented in a random order.

```{r s2a_rpm_timespent}
rpm_timespent_sec <- (as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_1_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_2_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_3_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_4_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_5_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_6_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_7_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_8_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_9_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_10_t_Page.Submit))

rpm_timespent_min <- (as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_1_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_2_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_3_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_4_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_5_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_6_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_7_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_8_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_9_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_10_t_Page.Submit))/60
```

#### Distractor task.

Because we were interested in testing the accessibility of these activities at the end of the study, we hoped to briefly distract participants with the intention of clearing the activities from working memory. To serve as this distraction, participants completed ten visual pattern-completion items from Raven's Progressive Matrices [@ravenraven2003], a test of general cognitive ability. On average, this distraction lasted `r myround(mean(rpm_timespent_min), digits = 2)` minutes. In each of these items, participants were presented with an image of a pattern with a missing piece, as well as with six to eight potential pieces, and were instructed to choose which piece was the right one to complete the pattern. Although we collected data measuring whether participants made the correct choices in response to these ten items, these data were unrelated to the present study, so they are not discussed further here.

#### Unaided recall task.

In order to measure the accessibility (i.e., output rank) of each activity, instructions reminded participants that earlier they rated the importance of 36 different activities, and asked them to recall as many of the activities as they can and list them in a series of 36 text boxes on the page. (The instructions also described that if participants did not remember all 36 activities, it is OK to leave some of the text boxes blank.) The data from this task were hand-coded by research assistants to ensure that the data included any activities recalled with minor misspellings (e.g., "perserve" instead of "preserve") as well as activities recalled in the form of a participle (e.g., "preserving"). For each recalled activity, coders noted the *output rank* of the activity—that is, whether the activity was listed in the first text box (i.e., an output rank of 1), the second text box (i.e., an output rank of 2), and so on. These output ranks were then log-transformed to normalize the distributions and then multiplied by -1 so that higher scores indicated greater output primacy (i.e., accessibility). Then, these output rank data were dummy-coded to produce a binary measure of output (0 = not recalled; 1 = recalled). Additionally, an *output total* score was calculated by summing the number of activities that each participant recalled.

```

#### Further measures.
As in Studies 1A and 1B, in order to control for any potential effects of stimulus length or frequency of use in the English language, we measured each of these variables for all activities. We also measured participants' prevention pride ($M$ = `r prev.eff_mean`; $SD$ = `r prev.eff_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r prev.eff_a`) and promotion pride ($M$ = `r prom.eff_mean`; $SD$ = `r prom.eff_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r prom.eff_a`) scores using the RFQ [@higginsetal2001], and their assessment (*M* = `r ass_mean`; *SD* = `r ass_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r ass_a`) and locomotion (*M* = `r loc_mean`; *SD* = `r loc_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r loc_a`) orientations using the RMQ [@kruglanskietal2000]. Although these data are available within the study dataset provided on the Open Science Framework project page (https://osf.io/LINK-TO-BE-ADDED), they are not discussed further here.

### Procedure.

After consenting to participate in the study, participants completed three motivational measures: the Regulatory Focus Strength measure, followed by the RMQ and the RFQ. Next, participants proceeded to the activity importance rating task, thus encountering all 36 activities for the first time. Then, participants completed the brief distractor, which was followed by the unaided recall task probing the output primacy of the various activities. Finally, after completing these tasks, participants optionally provided brief demographic information and were debriefed, thanked, and compensated.

## Results

### Data analysis strategy.
Because we hypothesized that the accessibility of prevention versus promotion activities would be associated with participants' own regulatory focus strength, our primary analysis examined whether the interaction between the hypothesized regulatory focus of a given activity and each participant's promotion (*vs.* prevention) strength dominance predicted the log-transformed output rank of the activity. In line with our analytic approach in Studies 1A and 1B, these data were analyzed within a Bayesian multilevel regression analysis. Each log-transformed output rank (i.e., our primary dependent variable) was regressed on the hypothesized activity regulatory focus (effect-coded: -0.5 = prevention; 0.5 = promotion), the participant's mean-centered promotion (*vs.* prevention) strength dominance, and the key interaction of interest between activity regulatory focus and promotion strength dominance. Other covariates included as fixed effects were activity frequency and activity length (both rescaled: *M* = 0; *SD* = 1). Random effects included in the model were random intercepts of participant and activity; random slopes of activity frequency and length by participant; and random slopes of promotion strength dominance by activity.

Importantly, as described in further detail below, we detected two sets of substantial correlations between participants' output total and both (a) one of our primary predictor variables (i.e., promotion strength dominance) and (b) our dependent variable (i.e., output rank). Given these correlations, we were interested in more precisely isolating the effects of the interaction between regulatory focus strength and the hypothesized regulatory focus on output *rank*, beyond any differences in their output *total*. As a result, although not initially planned, we re-conducted our primary analysis with output total included as a covariate. As we detail below, using `r cite_r(file = "manuscript/rf-activities.bib", pkgs = c("brms"), withhold = FALSE)`, we conducted a "leave-one-out" cross-validation analysis comparing the same model with and without the inclusion of output total. This model comparison procedure indicated that the model *with* this covariate was a better fit than the model without the covariate, and as a result, the results of this revised model are included below. (The model comparison analysis and all results using the original model *without* output total included as a covariate are provided in the Supplementary Material.)

Additionally, because we hypothesized that the most accessible activities would be recalled earliest in our memory task, we also examined a subset of the data that was recalled earliest in the study. These analyses indicated that our focal interaction is most strongly associated with accessibility (i.e., output rank) when including only the first 13 activities that participants recalled within the unaided recall task. As a result, we report the results of our original analyses including all recalled activities as well as the results of analyses including only participants' first 13 recalled activities below.

Finally, although our primary analysis contains data for all participants, given that these analyses differentiate between the average output rank for prevention versus promotion stimuli, we also conducted these analyses only including data for participants who remembered at least one prevention stimulus and at least one promotion stimulus. The results of these analyses are also presented in the Supplementary Material.

``` {r s2a_memtotal_promdom}
mfraw$memtotal_promdom <- mfraw$memtotal_prom - mfraw$memtotal_prev

# Bayesian regression with random intercepts for each stimulus and participant (commented out after initial analysis, as code takes a while to run; to re-run, un-comment the following three lines)
# set.seed(1234)
# memtotal_promdom_2a <- brm(memtotal_promdom ~ 1, data = mfraw, cores = 4, chains = 4)
# save(memtotal_promdom_2a, file = "models/memtotal_promdom_2a.rda")
load("models/memtotal_promdom_2a.rda")
# summary(memtotal_promdom_2a)
```

### Output total: Number of promotion- and prevention-specific activities recalled.

On average, participants recalled `r myround(mean(mfraw$memtotal), digits = 2)` total activities (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$memtotal), digits = 2)`) in the unaided recall task. Among these activities, participants recalled an average of `r myround(mean(mfraw$memtotal_mot), digits = 2)` activities that we hypothesized were associated with prevention or promotion (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$memtotal_mot), digits = 2)`). These recalled regulatory focus-specific activities comprised an average of `r myround(mean(mfraw$memtotal_prev), digits = 2)` prevention activities (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$memtotal_prev), digits = 2)`) and `r myround(mean(mfraw$memtotal_prom), digits = 2)` promotion activities (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$memtotal_prom), digits = 2)`). By estimating the difference between the number of prevention versus promotion recalled activities within a Bayesian linear regression model, we determined that participants recalled 0.56 (95% CI: -1.05, -0.09) more prevention-specific activities than promotion-specific activities.

``` {r s2a_logmemrank_promdom}
# Bayesian regression with random intercepts for each stimulus and participant (commented out after initial analysis, as code takes a while to run; to re-run, un-comment the following three lines)
# set.seed(1234)
# logmemrank_promdom_2a <- brm(logmemrank_promdom ~ 1, data = mfraw, cores = 4, chains = 4)
# save(logmemrank_promdom_2a, file = "models/logmemrank_promdom_2a.rda")
load("models/logmemrank_promdom_2a.rda")
# summary(logmemrank_promdom_2a)
```

### Output rank: Primacy of promotion- and prevention-specific activities recalled.

Across participants, the average log-transformed output rank among the recalled activities in the unaided recall task was `r myround(mean(mf$logmemrank, na.rm = T), digits = 2)` (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mf$logmemrank, na.rm = T), digits = 2)`). Prevention activities (*M* = `r myround(mean(mf$logmemrank[mf$stimrf == "prev"], na.rm = T), digits = 2)`; *SD* = `r myround(sd(mf$logmemrank[mf$stimrf == "prev"], na.rm = T), digits = 2)`) tended to be recalled slightly earlier than promotion activities (*M* = `r myround(mean(mf$logmemrank[mf$stimrf == "prom"], na.rm = T), digits = 2)`; *SD* = `r myround(sd(mf$logmemrank[mf$stimrf == "prom"], na.rm = T), digits = 2)`). However, by estimating the difference between log-transformed output rank promotion versus prevention activities within a Bayesian linear regression model, we determined that this difference did not differ from zero (95% CI: -0.30, 0.15).

### Correlations between output total and primary measures.

As mentioned above, our initial analyses revealed two sets of correlations between participants' output total and two variables included in our primary analyses, including a key predictor variable (i.e., promotion strength dominance) and our dependent variable (i.e., log-transformed output rank). More specifically, a Bayesian regression analysis revealed that the correlation between participants' promotion (*vs.* prevention) strength dominance and their output total revealed a correlation effect with a posterior distribution reflecting the equivalent of marginal significance in a null significance hypothesis testing framework (*r* = 0.25; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.49). Further, a second Bayesian regression analysis revealed that the correlation between participants' average log-transformed output rank and their output total differed from zero (*r* = -0.77; 95% CI: -0.86, -0.65). Given these correlations, we conducted a "leave-one-out" cross-validation analysis comparing models with and without output rank as a covariate. Because this model comparison procedure indicated that the model *with* this covariate was a better fit, the results of this revised model are included below (with all results using the original model in the Supplementary Material.)

We hypothesized that the interaction between participants' promotion (*vs.* prevention) strength dominance and the regulatory focus of each activity would predict that activity's log-transformed output rank. To investigate this question, we examined the model output from our Bayesian multilevel regression analysis (see the bolded line in Table 5). The effect size for this interaction was `r beff(table5[7, "Estimate"])` units, with a 95% credible interval that did not include zero (`r beff(table5[7, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table5[7, "Upper"])`). Based on this credible interval and the positive direction of the effect, and in line with Hypothesis 3, these results suggest that the interaction between these variables predicts activities' output rank. With each additional point of promotion (*vs.* prevention) strength dominance, participants will tend to output promotion (*vs.* prevention) activities earlier, indicating that this increase in motivational strength predicts an increase in the accessibility of motivationally relevant activities. (To visualize the model's predicted activity rank for promotion versus prevention activities as a function of promotion strength dominance, see Figure 5.) Finally, this analysis indicated that output total was the only other predictor of log-transformed output rank (*b* = `r beff(table5[4, "Estimate"])`; 95% CI: `r beff(table5[4, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table5[4, "Upper"])`).

A number of accessibility measures use output primacy to determine which participant responses are included in a given average score. One such example is the Regulatory Focus Strength measure [@higginsetal1997], which examines whether prevention-related oughts or promotion-related ideals are submitted and rated more quickly. In order to calculate prevention and promotion strength scores, researchers examine only the response latencies for only the nine attributes and ratings that participants submit earliest in the task. With this approach in mind, we conducted a number of exploratory analyses examining whether the interaction effect of interest would be more visible when testing only an early subset of the data. (Beyond this subsetting of the data, the model specification was not changed.) In conducting these exploratory analyses, we found that examining the first 13 activities recalled by participants provided a slightly improved view of this effect. The model output from this Bayesian multilevel regression analysis indicated an effect size for the key interaction of `r beff(table6[7, "Estimate"])` units, with a 95% credible interval that did not include zero (`r beff(table6[7, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table6[7, "Upper"])`; see the bolded line in Table 6). Based on this credible interval and the positive direction of the effect, these results suggest that the interaction between these variables predicts activities' output rank.

## Discussion

After first establishing the hypothesized associations between prevention- and promotion-specific goal pursuit activities in Studies 1A and 1B, Study 2A provided initial evidence that the associations between regulatory focus and various goal pursuit activities relate to the accessibility of these activities, operationalized as output primacy. In line with Hypothesis 3, participants' promotion (*vs.* prevention) strength dominance interacted with activities' regulatory focus to predict the activities' output rank. Further, the direction of this effect indicated that participants higher (*vs.* lower) in promotion strength dominance were more likely to output promotion (*vs.* prevention) activities earlier in the recall task, as this effect was directionally stronger when examining only participans' first 13 recalled activities.

Together with the results of Studies 1A and 1B, these findings provided convering evidence in support of proposed framework of prevention versus promotion goal pursuit activities. However, despite the study's strengths, one limitation of Study 2A is its use of *measured* regulatory focus strength, which prevented us from drawing any causal inferences about the variable's impact on activity accessibility. Further, as has been pointed out by other scholars [e.g., @scholeretal2010], it is important to conduct studies that involve the measurement *and* the manipulation of regulatory focus, as this combined set of results are needed to provide evidence that both chronic and situationally induced regulatory focus can influence the dependent measure of interest. Finally, given that Study 2A was conducted with an online sample, we intended to conduct Study 2B with an in-person sample recruited from our university community in order to test the generalizability of these findings.

# Study 2B

## Method

Study 2B aimed to replicate the findings of Study 2A within a pre-registered lab study. Importantly, Study 2B differed from Study 2A in that we experimentally manipulated participants' state regulatory focus using a well-established procedure. By using this regulatory focus strength manipulation (as opposed to measuring regulatory focus strength as in Study 2A), we were able to investigate whether differences in regulatory focus strength cause changes in the accessibility of motivationally relevant (*vs.* irrelevant) activities. We hypothesized that participants' assigned regulatory focus strength induction would interact with activity regulatory focus to predict log-transformed output rank, such that participants who completed a promotion (*vs.* prevention) induction would tend to output promotion (*vs.* prevention) activities earlier during the unaided recall task.

### Participants.

In order to determine the sample size for this study, we used `r cite_r(file = NULL)` to conduct a Bayesian equivalent of a power analysis following a simulation-based approach recommended by Kurz [-@kurz2019]. Given that the effect of interest may be smaller than the effect found in Study 2A, our goal was to obtain power of 0.90 to detect an effect of *b* = 0.20 at \( \alpha \) = 0.05. Our target sample size was 110 participants, and in order to (a) account for potential exclusions and (b) allow us to re-run all analyses among a sample of only native English speaking participants, we aimed to recruit 200 participants. We also pre-registered a stopping rule indicating that if we had collected data from at least 150 participants by the end of the Spring 2020 semester, despite not reaching the total sample size of 200, we would terminate data collection and proceed to data analysis.

Data collection took place between February 2020 and March 2020. Participants were members of the university community at a university in the northeastern U.S. who had opted in to receiving recruitment materials from a behavioral research lab on campus. All participants were paid \$5 for their time. Although our pre-registration included a stopping rule of 150 participants, given the Covid-19 pandemic, data collection ended with a hiatus on human subjects research mandated by the university in March 2020. As a result, Study 2B includes data from the `r n + nomem_mot + improper_rfind` participants who were recruited prior to this hiatus. Among this recruited sample, `r english(improper_rfind)` participants were excluded for failing to properly complete the regulatory focus induction manipulation, our primary independent variable, leaving a sample of `r n + nomem_mot` participants. Additionally, among these participants, `r english(nomem_mot)` participants failed to recall any activities from our framework at the end of the study (i.e., our primary dependent variable). These exclusions left a sample of `r n` participants ranging in age from `r minage` to `r maxage`, with a mean of `r meanage` years old (*SD* = `r sdage`). Participants were `r malepct`% male and `r femalepct`% female (with the remaining participants unspecified. They self-identified as `r asianpct`% Asian, `r whitepct`% White, `r multipct`% multiracial, `r hisppct`% Hispanic, and `r blackpct`% Black, with the remaining participants unspecified.

Per our pre-defined exclusion criteria, we then examined the number of participants who responded that they were not native English speakers, as if this number fell below 10%, we would have excluded this group. Because `r nonenglish` of the remaining `r n` participants (`r myround(nonenglishpct * 100, digits = 1)`%) reported a native language other than English, these participants were *not* excluded from our primary analyses. As described in the study's pre-registration, we also conducted all analyses excluding this group and noted very similar results; please see Supplementary Material for the results of all analyses conducted with this smaller sample.

### Materials and measures.

#### Regulatory focus strength induction.
We experimentally manipulated regulatory focus strength by randomly assigning participants to respond to either a prevention or promotion induction prompt. Originally developed by Higgins, Roney, Crowe, and Hymes [-@higginsetal1994], these inductions have been used successfully in a number of studies examining the effects of regulatory focus strength on a range of different cognitive and behavioral outcomes [e.g., @freitashiggins2002; @higginsetal1986; @libermanetal2001; @scholeretal2010]. The induction prompts direct participants to spend five to seven minutes writing about how their current duties and obligations (prevention) versus hopes and aspirations (promotion) are different now from what they were when they were growing up.

#### Activity list.

The activity list used in Study 2B was identical to the list of 39 activities used in Study 1B. Importantly, it included the same 12 activities hypothesized to relate to prevention and 12 activities hypothesized to relate to promotion. Similar to Study 2A, the regulatory focus of each of these activities was effect-coded (-0.5 = prevention; 0.5 = promotion) and manipulated on a within-participants basis in the activity importance rating task described next.

#### Activity importance rating task.
The activity importance rating task used in Study 2B was very similar to the version of the task used in Study 2A, but it contained several minor differences. Given the slightly broadened activity list in Study 2B (39 *vs.* 36), participants made 39 activity ratings. Further, in Study 2B, activities were rated on a nine-point Likert scale (1 = *not important at all* to 9 = *absolutely essential*), rather than the 101-point sliding scale. Finally, although nearly all activities were presented and rated in a random order, the activity "sleep" was rated first by all participants.

```{r s2b_rpm_timespent}
rpm_timespent_sec <- (as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_2_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_4_t_Page.Submit) +
                        as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_9_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_10_t_Page.Submit))

rpm_timespent_min <- (as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_2_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_4_t_Page.Submit) +
                        as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_9_t_Page.Submit) + as.numeric(mfraw$rpm_10_t_Page.Submit))/60
```

#### Distractor task.

In Study 2B, in order to adhere to timing and payment requirements in the research lab in which the study took place, we administered a condensed version of the distractor task used in Study 2A. This distractor task in Study 2B consisted of four pattern-completion items from Raven's Progressive Matrices [@ravenraven2003]. On average, this distraction lasted `r myround(mean(rpm_timespent_min), digits = 2)` minutes.

#### Unaided recall task.

In Study 2B, in order to measure the accessibility (i.e., output rank) of each activity, participants completed an unaided recall task nearly identical to the unaided recall task administered in Study 2A, but with 39 blank text boxes instead of 36 (to reflect the difference in the length of the activity list). As in Study 2A, the data from this task were hand-coded by research assistants to ensure the inclusion of any activities recalled with minor misspellings or different verb forms (e.g., participles). For each recalled activity, coders noted the output rank of the activity, and these output ranks were then log-transformed to normalize the distributions and multiplied by -1 so that higher scores indicated greater output primacy. Then, these output rank data were dummy-coded to produce a binary measure of output (0 = not recalled; 1 = recalled), and an "output total" score was calculated by summing the number of activities that each participant recalled.

ass$rmq_27 <- 7 - ass$rmq_27
ass_a <- psych::alpha(ass)$total$raw_alpha
rm(ass)
```

#### Further measures.
As in Studies 1A and 1B, in order to control for any potential effects of stimulus length or frequency of use in the English language, we measured each of these variables for all activities. Additionally, we measured participants' prevention pride ($M$ = `r prev.eff_mean`; $SD$ = `r prev.eff_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r prev.eff_a`) and promotion pride ($M$ = `r prom.eff_mean`; $SD$ = `r prom.eff_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r prom.eff_a`) scores using the RFQ [@higginsetal2001], and their assessment (*M* = `r ass_mean`; *SD* = `r ass_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r ass_a`) and locomotion (*M* = `r loc_mean`; *SD* = `r loc_sd`; \( \alpha \) = `r loc_a`) orientations using the RMQ [@kruglanskietal2000]. Although these data are available within the study dataset provided on the Open Science Framework project page (https://osf.io/LINK-TO-BE-ADDED), they are not discussed further here.

### Procedure.

This study involved an experimental lab design containing two purportedly separate studies. The purpose of this "multiple-study paradigm" design was to prevent participants' responses to tasks they completed in the first part of the study from biasing their performance in later tasks. Upon providing consent, participants learned that they would begin a purported Study 1 investigating how people's standards change over time. Using complete random assignment, each participant was assigned to one of the two
between-subjects regulatory focus induction conditions (prevention *vs.* promotion). After completing this induction, participants were directed to a purported Study 2 on the topic of motivation and problem solving. Participants then proceeded to the activity importance rating task, thus encountering all 39 activities for the first time. Then, participants completed the brief distractor task, which was followed by the unaided recall task probing the output primacy of the various activities. After completing these tasks, participants completed our two exploratory motivational measures: the RMQ and the RFQ. Finally, participants optionally provided brief demographic information and were debriefed, thanked, and compensated.

## Results

### Data analysis strategy.
As in Study 2A, and in line with Hypothesis 3, we predicted that the accessibility of prevention versus promotion activities, operationalized as output rank, would be associated with participants' regulatory focus strength. However, one key difference in Study 2B was that regulatory focus strength was manipulated, rather than measured. Thus, our primary analysis examined whether the interaction between the hypothesized regulatory focus of a given activity and each participant's *experimentally induced* regulatory focus strength predicted the log-transformed output rank of the activity. Like our analytic approach in Studies 1A and 1B, these data were analyzed within a Bayesian multilevel regression analysis. This model was specified identically to the model used in Study 2A's primary analysis, with the exception of participants' promotion (*vs.* prevention) strength dominance; in Study 2B, this variable was replaced with an effect-coded variable reflecting participants' regulatory focus induction condition (-0.5 = prevention, 0.5 = promotion).

Additionally, as in Study 2A and as described further below, we were particularly interested in how output *rank* (i.e., a measure of output primacy) was influenced by the interaction between induced regulatory focus strength and the hypothesized regulatory focus, beyond any differences in output *total*. We detected two sets of substantial correlations between participants' output total and both one of our primary independent variables (i.e., regulatory focus induction condition) and our dependent variable (i.e., output rank). Given these correlations, we re-conducted our primary analysis with output total included as a covariate. As we detail below, a "leave-one-out" cross-validation analysis comparing the same model with and without the inclusion of output total indicated that the model *with* this covariate was a better fit. As a result, like in Study 2A, the results of this revised model are included below. (The model comparison analysis and all results using the original model *without* output total included as a covariate are provided in the Supplementary Material.)

Further, because we hypothesized that accessible activities would be recalled earliest in our memory task, as in Study 2A, we also conducted our primary analysis with a subset of the data containing only the first 13 activities that participants recalled within the unaided recall task, because these earlier (*vs.* later) recalled activities are more likely to reflect output primacy. As a result, we report the results of both our analyses conducted the full dataset as well as the results of analyses that included only participants' first 13 recalled activities below. Additionally, we conducted an exploratory exact binomial test of goodness-of-fit to examine the differences in the accessibility (i.e., output rank) of prevention versus promotion activities in the prevention versus promotion induction conditions. The results of this analysis are also provided below.

Finally, although our primary analysis contains data for all participants, given that these analyses differentiate between the average output rank for promotion versus prevention activities, we also conducted these analyses only including data for participants who remembered at least one promotion activity and at least one prevention activity. The results of these analyses are presented in the Supplementary Material.

mfraw$memtotal_promdom <- mfraw$memtotal_prom - mfraw$memtotal_prev

# set.seed(1234)
# memtotal_promdom_2b <- brm(memtotal_promdom ~ 1, data = mfraw, cores = 4, chains = 4)
# save(memtotal_promdom_2b, file = "models/memtotal_promdom_2b.rda")
load("models/memtotal_promdom_2b.rda")
# summary(memtotal_promdom_2b)
```

### Output total: Number of promotion- and prevention-specific activities recalled.

On average, participants recalled `r myround(mean(mfraw$memtotal), digits = 2)` total activities (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$memtotal), digits = 2)`) in the unaided recall task. Among these recalled activities, participants recalled an average of `r myround(mean(mfraw$memtotal_mot), digits = 2)` activities that we hypothesized were associated with prevention or promotion (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$memtotal_mot), digits = 2)`). These recalled regulatory focus-specific activities comprised an average of `r myround(mean(mfraw$memtotal_prev), digits = 2)` prevention activities (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$memtotal_prev), digits = 2)`) and `r myround(mean(mfraw$memtotal_prom), digits = 2)` promotion activities (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$memtotal_prom), digits = 2)`). However, by estimating the difference between the number of promotion versus prevention recalled activities within a Bayesian linear regression model, we determined that this difference did not differ from zero (95% CI: -0.30, 0.15).

``` {r s2b_memtotal_condition}

load("models/memtotal_condition_2b.rda")
# summary(memtotal_condition_2b)
```

<!--#### Total number of regulatory focus-specific activities recalled in the promotion versus prevention induction conditions.

Participants in the prevention induction condition recalled an average of `r myround(mean(mfraw$memtotal[mfraw$condition == "Prevention"]), digits = 2)` total activities (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$memtotal[mfraw$condition == "Prevention"]), digits = 2)`), whereas participants in the promotion induction condition recalled an average of `r myround(mean(mfraw$memtotal[mfraw$condition == "Promotion"]), digits = 2)` regulatory focus-specific activities (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mfraw$memtotal[mfraw$condition == "Promotion"]), digits = 2)`). By estimating the difference between the number of activities recalled in each of these conditions within a Bayesian linear regression model, we determined that participants in the promotion induction condition recalled 1.36 more regulatory focus-specific activities than did participants in the prevention induction condition. Although the confidence interval for this difference included zero (95% CI: -1.05, -0.09), with a posterior distribution reflecting the equivalent of marginal significance in a null significance hypothesis testing framework-->

```

### Output rank: Primacy of promotion- and prevention-specific activities recalled.

Across participants, the average log-transformed output rank among the recalled activities in the unaided recall task was `r myround(mean(mf$logmemrank, na.rm = T), digits = 2)` (*SD* = `r myround(sd(mf$logmemrank, na.rm = T), digits = 2)`). In contrast to Study 2A, promotion activities (*M* = `r myround(mean(mf$logmemrank[mf$stimrf == "prom"], na.rm = T), digits = 2)`; *SD* = `r myround(sd(mf$logmemrank[mf$stimrf == "prom"], na.rm = T), digits = 2)`) tended to be recalled slightly earlier than prevention activities (*M* = `r myround(mean(mf$logmemrank[mf$stimrf == "prev"], na.rm = T), digits = 2)`; *SD* = `r myround(sd(mf$logmemrank[mf$stimrf == "prev"], na.rm = T), digits = 2)`). However, by estimating the difference between log-transformed output rank promotion versus prevention activities within a Bayesian linear regression model, we determined that this difference did not differ from zero (95% CI: -0.00, 0.23).

```{r s2b_memtotal_cors}

# memtotal_promprev <- brm(data = mfraw, family = student, mvbind(memtotal, condition.e) ~ 1, iter = 2000, warmup = 500, chains = 4, cores = 4)
# save(memtotal_promprev, file = "models/memtotal_promprev.rda")
load("models/memtotal_promprev.rda")
# summary(memtotal_promprev) # r = .16 [-.02, .34]

# set.seed(1234)
# memtotal_memrank_2b <- brm(data = mfraw, family = student, mvbind(memtotal, logmemrank_mot) ~ 1, iter = 2000, warmup = 500, chains = 4, cores = 4)

load("models/memtotal_memrank_2b.rda")
# summary(memtotal_memrank_2b) # r = -.78 [-.84, -.69]
```

As mentioned above, like in Study 2A, our initial analyses revealed two sets of correlations between participants' output total and two variables included in our primary analyses. More specifically, a Bayesian regression analysis revealed that the correlation between participants' effect-coded regulatory focus induction condition (-0.5 = prevention; 0.5 = promotion) and their output total revealed a correlation effect with a posterior distribution reflecting the equivalent of marginal significance in a null significance hypothesis testing framework (*r* = 0.16; 95% CI: -0.02, 0.34). Further, a second Bayesian regression analysis revealed that the correlation between participants' average log-transformed output rank and their output total differed from zero (*r* = -0.78; 95% CI: -0.84, -0.69). Given these correlations, like in Study 2A, we conducted our primary analysis with output total (mean-centered and scaled) included as a covariate, and then conducted a "leave-one-out" cross-validation analysis comparing models including versus exclusing output total. This analysis indicated that the model *with* this covariate was a better fit. Thus, as in Study 2A, the results of this revised model are included below. (All results using the original model *without* output total included as a covariate are provided in the Supplementary Material.)

We hypothesized that the interaction between participants' promotion (*vs.* prevention) strength dominance and the regulatory focus of each activity would predict that activity's log-transformed output rank. To investigate this question, we examined the model output from our Bayesian multilevel regression analysis (see the bolded line in Table 7). The effect size for this interaction was `r beff(table7[7, "Estimate"])` units, with a 95% credible interval that included zero (`r beff(table7[7, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table7[7, "Upper"])`). Based on this credible interval, contrary to Hypothesis 3, these results did *not* indicate that the interaction between these variables influences activities' output rank. Additionally, this analysis indicated that output total was the only predictor of log-transformed output rank (*b* = `r beff(table7[4, "Estimate"])`; 95% CI: `r beff(table7[4, "Lower"])`, `r beff(table7[4, "Upper"])`).

Like in Study 2A, we also conducted an exploratory analysis with a subset of the data containing only the first 13 activities recalled by participants. The model output from this Bayesian multilevel regression analysis indicated an effect size for the interaction of interest of `r beff(table8[7, "Estimate"])` units, with a 95% credible interval that did not cross zero (0.002, `r beff(table8[7, "Upper"])`; see the bolded line in Table 8 and Figure 6).

### Exploratory analysis: Binomial exact test.

In addition to the Bayesian regression analyses described above, we also conducted an exploratory binomial exact test of goodness-of-fit to compare on an activity-specific basis the log-transformed output rank among participants who completed a prevention versus promotion strength induction. Beginning with the subset of data comprising participants' first 13 recalled activities in the recall task, we calculated the mean log-transformed output rank for each activity in the prevention condition and the promotion condition. Next, for each activity, we calculated an activity-specific promotion (*vs.* prevention) dominance score in terms of log-transformed output rank by subtracting the mean in the prevention condition from the mean in the promotion condition. Then, we compared each of the promotion activities with each of the prevention activities based upon these activity-specific output rank promotion-dominance scores. (See Figure 7 for a visualization of these scores.) Given that our dataset included such scores for 12 promotion activities and 12 prevention activities, we compared these scores for 144 activity pairs. In 109 of these 144 activity pairs, the promotion activity had an output rank score higher in promotion-dominance than the prevention activity (in line with our Hypothesis 3). Importantly, if these activities did *not* differ in their relevance to the promotion versus prevention systems, we would not have expected the proportion of activity pairings in line with our hypotheses to differ from chance (i.e., 72 of the 144 pairings). Based on a two-sided binomial test, these observed values differ significantly from the "chance" proportion, *p* < .0001.

(ref:fig7cap) Mean difference in log-transformed output rank for each regulatory focus-specific activity among participants in the promotion versus prevention strength induction condition, when calculated based on the subset of data containing participants' first 13 recalled activities (Study 2B). On average, activities with values greater than zero were more accessible following a promotion (vs. prevention) induction; activities with values less than zero were more accessible following a prevention (vs. promotion) induction.

## Discussion

Study 2B provided some additional evidence for Hypothesis 3, revealing that the interaction between regulatory focus strength and activity regulatory focus produced differences in the accessibility of these activities when specifically examining the 13 activities recalled first in the unaided recall task. This evidence from Bayesian regression analyses similar to those conducted in Study 2A was complemented by converging evidence resulting from our exploratory binomial exact test.

Interestingly, when our primary analysis was conducted with the log-transformed output rank data for *all* recalled activities, the size of the interaction effect of interest was approximately halved and the 95% credible interval for interaction effect shifted to include zero. This finding may illuminate an important boundary condition of the effects highlighted in the present research: While inducing a promotion or prevention focus does appear to influence the accessibility of relevant activities, the extent of this effect may depend on output primacy. Additionally, although we found a slight increase in the size of the key interaction effect in Study 2A when examining only the first 13 recalled activities, this difference was far larger in Study 2B. This distinction may relate to the fact that participants' regulatory focus in Study 2A was determined using a measure of their chronic regulatory focus, whereas in Study 2B, we created a situational change in regulatory focus using an experimental manipulation. In practical terms, the minor differences in the results of Studies 2A and 2B suggest that although a given situation may prime a prevention or promotion focus, and this state regulatory focus may influence the relevance of different goal pursuit activities, this increase in motivational relevance may not be maintained indefinitely. In contrast, individual differences in the dominance of people's regulatory focus strength may be relatively more stable. Together with the results of Study 2A, these findings provided converging experimental support for our hypothesized framework.

# General Discussion

Although the prevention and promotion systems posited within regulatory focus theory are known to be associated with distinct goal pursuit activities, investigations into these assocations have seemingly lacked a comprehensive guiding framework. To the best of our knowledge, the present research is the first to put forth such a framework, which details the different kinds of truth- and control-oriented goal pursuit activities motivated by promotion and prevention. By combining regulatory focus theory, which has been traditionally conceptualized in the domain of value, with truth and control, this novel framework integrates distinct theories of motivation that have not previously been studied together. In doing so, it highlights the dynamic interplay of various motivational systems that drive human behavior.

Across four studies using both experimental and correlational methods, our results indicated that the associations between (a) the prevention and promotion systems and (b) regulatory focus-specific goal pursuit activities are broadly available, highly accessible, and interact with individual differences in regulatory focus strength to predict the activities' motivational relevance. Importantly, this work extends the distinction between the prevention system's preference for vigilance and the promotion system's preference for eagerness [@crowehiggins1997; @higginsetal1994] to propose how these general tendencies influence the motivational relevance of unique activities. In doing so, it integrates past regulatory focus research examining system-specific preferences tendencies related to topics as wide-ranging as curiosity, political ideology, discounting under uncertainty, and leadership styles. It is our hope that this framework will be useful and generative in suggesting opportunities for future research. With this framework as a guide, scholars can explore how the interactions of these systems relate to other motivational constructs. For instance, the motivational orientation of assessment within regulatory mode theory [@kruglanskietal2000] is primarily motivated by a truth-oriented desire to engage in critical evaluation and is associated with distress in decision-making, mediated by fear of making the wrong choice [i.e., an anticipated "-1" state; @chenetal2018]. Given that these tendencies appear to fall within the activity domain of prevention-truth, this framework raises the question of if and how assessment relates to the prevention system.

This framework also has important implications for the study of goal-directed behavior and performance, and offers an approach to begin filling critical gaps in the field’s knowledge of goal pursuit processes. This proposal is grounded in Eitam and Higgins' [-@eitamhiggins2010] relevance of a representation framework, which posits that motivationally relevant constructs influence cognition and behavior. If the prevention versus promotion systems systematically motivate distinct goal pursuit activities as suggested by the present research, future studies should examine these proposed behavioral implications explicitly. We would hypothesize that: (a) these associations between regulatory focus and goal pursuit activities will be reflected in actual behavioral choices, and (a) present concern with each of these four motive domains will enhance performance on activities in that domain. To test these hypotheses experimentally, researchers could manipulate participants’ current motivational concerns by creating writing inductions specific to each activity domain and then measure task choice and performance. By studying how the interactions of these motives affect goal-directed activity, this research will provide valuable insight on why and how goal pursuit processes vary. Further, if these inductions are effective, these results would confirm that these activity-specific motives are manipulable and suggest how, through related real-world interventions, people might engage in more effective goal pursuit journeys. Given that both economic success and well-being relate to how effectively people pursue their goals, we suggest that this is a worthy goal [@ameriksetal2003; @klugmaier2015].
